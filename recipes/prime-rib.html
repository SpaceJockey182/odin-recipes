    <h3>Description</h2>
    <p> Prime rib claims center stage during holiday season for a very good reason. 
        It is the king of beef cuts. A bone-in prime rib roast is also called a 
        standing rib roast, because you position the roast majestically on its 
        rib bones in the roasting pan to cook it. Beautifully marbled with fat, 
        this roast is rich, juicy, and tenderâ€”a feast for the eyes and the belly. 
    </p>
